# SQL + Power BI Layoffs Data Analysis Project (2020–2023)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing layoffs data from various companies and locations between 2020 and 2023.

The workflow follows an end-to-end data analysis pipeline:

* Data Cleaning (MySQL)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL)
* Data Visualization (Power BI)

The goal was to convert raw, inconsistent data into a structured format and derive meaningful insights using interactive dashboards.

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- End-to-end data analysis project (SQL + Power BI)
- Cleaned real-world layoffs dataset (2020–2023)
- Built interactive dashboard with KPI metrics and trend analysis
- Identified key patterns across companies, countries, and time

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* MySQL
* MySQL Workbench
* Power BI

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning (SQL)

The raw dataset contained duplicates, inconsistent formatting, and missing values. The following steps were performed:

* Created staging tables to preserve raw data
* Identified and removed duplicate records using `ROW_NUMBER()`
* Trimmed extra spaces from company names
* Standardized inconsistent values (industry, country)
* Converted date column from text format to `DATE`
* Replaced string `'NULL'` values with actual `NULL`
* Populated missing industry values using self-joins
* Removed rows with insufficient layoff data
* Dropped helper columns after cleaning

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL)

Performed SQL-based analysis to understand patterns in layoffs:

* Total layoffs across dataset
* Layoffs by country
* Layoffs by year
* Monthly layoff trends
* Top companies by layoffs

---

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard

The cleaned dataset was visualized using Power BI to create an interactive and insight-driven dashboard.

### 🔹 Dashboard Features:

* KPI Cards:

  * Total Layoffs
  * Top Country
  * Top Company
* Trend Analysis:

  * Layoffs over time (2020–2023)
* Comparative Analysis:

  * Top 5 countries by layoffs
  * Top 5 companies by layoffs
